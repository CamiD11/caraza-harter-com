You had created a grocery shopping list (`orig_list`), but just
learned a will be visiting you who dislikes anchovies, apples, and
spinach.  Complete the following code to `append` everything from the
old list to a new list, except for the disliked items.  Remember that
the `in` operator can check whether a value is in a particular list.

```python
orig_list = ["anchovies", "carrots", "cabbage", "SPINACH", "pineapple"]
dislikes = ["anchovies", "apples", "spinach"]
new_list = []

for ???? in ????:
    if not item ?? dislikes:
        new_list.????(item)
        
new_list
```
