# Practice

In what decade is 2023?  The answer is the decade of 2020, but how
could we write general code to compute that?  By "general", it means
the code needs to still compute the proper decade if the year
changes. For example, 1999 would be the decade of 1990.

The modulo (remainder) operator is often useful in expressions that
extract specific digits from a number.

For example, this gives 3, indicating 2023 is year 3 within the 2020
decade:

```python
2023 % 10
```

Use the idea above to complete the following expression (replacing
`????`) to compute the decade containing the year 2023:

```python
2023 - (????)
```

Create a Jupyter notebook and paste your code in a cell to check your solution.
