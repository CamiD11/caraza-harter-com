# Practice

You have an apple pie.  Cut yourself one slice, exactly 25% of the
total pie size.  It is quite tasty, so you eat another slice, 25% of
what remained after the first time.

The nice thing about this approach of eating smaller and smaller
slices is that you can have unlimited slices without running out of
pie.

How many slices must you eat, though, to have consumed at least 99% of
the original pie?  Complete the code to find out.

```python
pie = 1
slices = 0
while ????:
    ???? # update pie
    slices += 1
slices
```
