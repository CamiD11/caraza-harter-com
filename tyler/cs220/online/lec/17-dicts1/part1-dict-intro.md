Step 1: create a `country.py` file with the following, and complete the missing code.  Then test your program in the terminal.

```python
capitals = {"China": "Beijing", "India": "New Delhi", "US": "Washington, DC"}
country = input("Enter a country: ")
capital = capitals[????]
print("The capital of {} is {}".format(country, capital))
```

Step 2: add at least two more countries (of your choice) to the dictionary, then test that the program can now look those up too.
