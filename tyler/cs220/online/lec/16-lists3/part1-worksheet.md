Paste and run the following:

```python
rows = [ ["x", "y", "name"], [3, 4, "Alice"], [9, 1, "Bob"], [-3, 4, "Cindy"] ]
header = rows[0]
data = rows[1:]
```

Now complete the following to compute the average y value (should be 3.0):

```python
yidx = header.????("y")
total = 0
for row in ????:
    total += row[yidx]
print(total / ????)
```
