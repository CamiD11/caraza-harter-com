  1. Strings (pre-typed examples during demo)

* Fix database 2 lecture template file grammatical issues with questions
* Fix formatting of pandas (may be) worksheet docx version
* Move class forms as a separate tab in the course website
* Re-define penalty policy for:
  1. Skipping test.py execution for later projects
  2. Path hard coding for later projects
  3. Taking advantage of resubmission policy - change course syllabus
