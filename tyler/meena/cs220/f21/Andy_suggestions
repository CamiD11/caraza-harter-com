Andy's Notes for fall 2021

Projects:

General: 
- From P3 on, students should be encouraged to write functions that take parameters.  Specific guidance should be given for most questions.
- Deduction rules should be shared with students when the project is published. Deduction rules should be stated in a positive fashion.
- Tests should fail early after writing a function, not later (edge cases tested early) 
- fewer new questions, more questions that are testing other cases (Pokemon, Tweets)
- this statement appeared in multiple project directions and it needs to be rewritten for clarity: 
"Think twice before creating a function without any parameters. Defining a new functions is unnecessary sometimes. The advantage of writing functions is that we can reuse the same code. If we only use this function once, there is no need to create a new function."

Project 9: Some of the questions were unclear in terms of what resutls were expected.  
In some cases, the ordering of the problems did not help students write code that could be reused.
Q9: it was not clear that if the title started with ", the student needed to grab the next char.
Q11: I had to remove 3 genres that had 0 entries from my list to pass the test, but they should have been in the test
Q14: The hint was not helpful.  Students can solve most of these problems using lambda and map.
Q15: The test.py did not accept my answer due to ordering of the list.  This should be changed.

Office Hours:
1.  Idea to first have all sign up for 2 office hours in the most demanding times, then have all sign up for OH in remaining times
